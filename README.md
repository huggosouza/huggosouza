### Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I’m currently working on DSOS (Desenvolvimento de Sistemas Operacionais Simples, or Simple Operational Systems Development, in English), with the RatoOS Project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Assembly for OS development, i'm in the very beginning so i don't know much yet.
- 👯 I’m looking for projects to collaborate to, but I'm very interested in Bitcoin and crypto-related projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my project (RatoOS), and if someone can teach me C++, Assembly (or even Flutter) I would be very thankful.
- 💬 Ask me about: Aviation, animes, technologies, programming and music.
- 📫 How to reach me: My Twitter user is: @hedson111
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm very into learning programming, but what I really want to do is to fix airplanes.
