- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DSOS (Desenvolvimento de Sistemas Operacionais Simples, or Simple Operational Systems Development, in English), with the RatoOS Project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning C++ and Assembly for OS development too, I'm in the very beginning so I don't know much yet.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for projects to collaborate to, but I'm very interested in Bitcoin and crypto-related projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my project (RatoOS), and if someone can teach me C++, Assembly (or even Flutter) I would be very thankful.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Aviation, animes, technologies, programming, music and languages (specially Portuguese - my native language - and English).
